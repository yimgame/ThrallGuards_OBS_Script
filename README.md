## 🧡 Message to the OBS Community

Hey everyone!  
I'm Yim, and this is the very first OBS script I've shared.  
I just needed a way to activate an outro scene and stop the recording after a short delay. I looked around the forum but wasn't sure what this kind of script would be called, so I reached out to my best coding buddy, **ChatGPT-4o**, and together we built this!

It's a **simple script**, but it gets the job done. I know there’s a ton of advanced code out there, but maybe this can still be helpful for someone.

Any feedback or suggestions are very welcome.  
Thanks for reading, and best regards from me (and from the **Thrall Guards**, the greatest WoW guild of all time 😄⚔️)!
